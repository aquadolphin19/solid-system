        <p>Dophins are my favorite animal. They are grey, and very smooth and soft to touch. they breath through a blowhole on top of their heads They are very intelligent, and currently there are 42 speices of them. They are marine mammals and have fun blowing bubbles underwater. They eat fish, squid and  crustaceans. When they sleep, half of their brain is asleep, and half awake, one eye open to look out for predators. They talk to each other with littlw squeaks, clicks, squacks and moans. Fishing nets and plastic pieces really harm many animals, including dolphins as they get tangled up in them and can die or be severly injured. I really love watching them be free, and with their pod, jumping around, not cooped up in an aquarium. Once at the beach early in the morning, I was swimming and saw some dolphins up ahead! It was really nice.</p>
